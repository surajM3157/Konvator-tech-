# Flutter MVVM Post Viewer Application
This Flutter application demonstrates an MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. It fetches posts from an API and displays them in a list. Users can view details, mark posts as read, and observe timer functionality. The app uses Provider for state management and supports local storage for data persistence.
